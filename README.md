================

Several solution proposals for the Quora Answer Classifier problem (https://www.quora.com/challenges#answer_classifier).

## Running the simulation

The simulation script is straightforward. The `quora.py` is the entry point of the simulation and it contains several experiments that were studied in order to propose a simple solution to the Quora Answer Classifier. To run the simulation, issue the command:

    $ python quora.py

Note that the simulation requires the libraries [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) and [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/). It is recommended to install them using [virtualenv](http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/).
